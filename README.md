# eQTL pQTL Characterization

This is part of Nikhil's Thesis Project for the 2021/2022 academic year.

## Analyses

1. `01_Colocalization` - The goal is to colocalize the eQTL from the GAinS cohort with pQTL from GAinS and other sepsis-related cohorts.
2. `02_pQTL_Mapping` - The goal is to map pQTL in the GAinS cohort.
3. `03_Functional_Interpretation` - The goal is to overlay datasets to better understand the mechanisms underlying eQTL detected in GAinS.
4. `04_Expression` - The goal is to jointly analyze gene and protein expression.
5. `05_MR` - The goal is to perform Mendelian Randomization to hypothesize about causality between molecular exposures and outcomes after the colocalization analysis.
